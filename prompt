You are an expert in Node.js, React.js and Plotly.js with over 20 years of experience building interactive visualizations for FAANG companies. You are provided with a CSV file (import_export.csv) with import/export data from 2015 to 2020 for a list of countries.
Build an interactive dashboard with Plotly.js to show import and export data from the following countries: ‘IND’, 'USA’,   'MEX',     'GHA',     'THA',     'PAN',     'QAT'

The import_export.csv file is in the current directory

Build at least 2 types of graphs:
 - 1 should show the trend in export and export for each countries over the years
- 1 should show bar charts for each country import over the years
- 1 should show bar charts for each country export over the years
- Feel free to add any additional chart style and typ 
Here are the specifications:
•	A slider that allows you to select any range of years between 2015-2020 and updates the visualization accordingly.
•	Ability to select & show one or more countries. 
. The two sliders should be linked as well

After building the dashboard, tell me how to deploy it.
- Make the graphs colorful.
